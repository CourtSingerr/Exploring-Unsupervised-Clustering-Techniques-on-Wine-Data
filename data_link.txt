Wine Dataset for Unsupervised Learning Analysis

The dataset used in this project consists of the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis quantifies 13 continuous features, which are chemical properties of the wine.

Description of the Dataset:
- 178 samples of wine
- 13 chemical features used for clustering
- Features include Alcohol content, Malic acid, Ash, Alkalinity of ash, Magnesium, Total phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid phenols, Proanthocyanins, Color intensity, Hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines, and Proline.

This dataset was preprocessed and cleaned, with no missing values, and is publicly available for educational purposes.
